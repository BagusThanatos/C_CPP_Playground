# Let's play!

## My Development Environment
4coder(https://4coder.itch.io/4coder) is my text editor of choice as it's simple and fast. No, I don't use GVim on my own, I'd only use it if I have to.
It's still in the alpha release though, so beware. Ah I sometimes also use Notepad++.

## Coding Conventions:
I'm not following the usual C/C++ that separate codes to headers and implementations.
There's no technical difference to `.h` and `.cpp/.c` files after all. More translation units just make compilation longer.
I will possibly try to stick to C99 with some C++ features cherry picked.

## Structure
This repository will contain my attempts on playing with the C/C++ programming Language.
Each folder will represent different 'plays' and need to be build separately. There will be separate build executable for all of them.

## Before Building and Running
# For linux
Please make sure you have clang installed in your machine.

# For Windows
Please make sure you have Visual Studio installed. Make change to the build files accordingly.

## Building and Running
I'm not planning to use make or cmake or the likes. 
With that, just run build.sh or build.bat from each FOLDER. Do not build from the project root folder.
TODO(Bagus): Make the build script run test cases found.
